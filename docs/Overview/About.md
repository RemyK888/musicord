## üçî A summary of the story

Okay, I'm going to try to make this quick. Basically I woke up one morning, ate cereal for breakfast and while brushing my teeth I suddenly thought "I want a hamburger".
So I went out and bought a burger, went home and ate my burger and said "I'm going to create a music package for Discord bots".

It didn't happen exactly like that, but almost.

## ‚ùì About

Musicord is a package specially designed for [Discord.js v14](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) and [@discordjs/voice v9](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/voice), so it is not compatible with version 13.
Thanks to its many intuitive and easy-to-use features, it is suitable for beginners as well as for advanced bot developers.

This project is regularly updated by [**RemyK**](https://github.com/RemyK888) (`RemyK#3876`) and [**ArthurLeo**](https://github.com/ArthurLeo13) (`Arthur_Leo#7463`).

## üöÄ I found an error, anything to add?

If you encounter difficulties in using this package despite this wonderful documentation, you can join the [RemyK Discord server](https://discord.gg/UBUSgw4), or [create an issue](https://github.com/RemyK888/musicord/issues/new) on the [Github](https://github.com/RemyK888/musicord) of the project.

Otherwise, if you have an idea, a suggestion, we invite you to contact us to discuss this suggestion.

## ‚ôæÔ∏è Upcoming additions
 - Spotify search and stream
 - More audio filters
 - Cool new features (but I don't know what exactly yet)
 - More and more audio filters

And I think that's pretty good
