# ðŸŽµ Discord music system

The ancestor of musicord is the NPM package named **"discord-music-system".**

Although developed in 2020, and not much updated since May 2021, it remains fully functional for Discord bots integrating [Discord.js version 12](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js/v/12.5.3) and the corresponding version of [@discordjs/opus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/opus/v/0.5.0).

Today, it is no longer maintained and is deprecated, however it remains a safe alternative if you use Discord.js v12.
